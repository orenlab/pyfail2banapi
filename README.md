# Python Fail2Ban API

## Overview

The Python Fail2Ban API is a FastAPI-based application designed to interact with Fail2Ban statistics. It provides
RESTful endpoints to retrieve Fail2Banâ€™s overall status, individual jail status, and version information, making it
ideal for integrating with automation systems like bots.

## Features

- **Fail2Ban Status**: Retrieve real-time service status.
- **Jail Status**: Query the status of individual jails.
- **Version Information**: Fetch the installed Fail2Ban version.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **Poetry**: For managing dependencies and the virtual environment
- **Fail2Ban**: Installed on your system

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository as the root user:

   ```bash
   sudo -i
   cd /root
   git clone https://github.com/orenlab/pyfail2banapi.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Poetry Virtual Environment**

   Navigate to the project directory and set up the environment using Poetry:

   ```bash
   cd /root/pyfail2banapi
   poetry install --only main
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   Activate the environment using Poetry to run the API within the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Start the FastAPI application using Poetry:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
   ```

5. **Systemd Service Configuration**

   To run the API as a service from `/root/pyfail2banapi/app.py`, create a systemd service file at
   `/etc/systemd/system/fail2ban-api.service`:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Fail2Ban API Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/root/.venv/bin/uvicorn pyfail2banapi.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
   User=root
   Group=root
   WorkingDirectory=/root/pyfail2banapi
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5
   LimitNOFILE=4096
   LimitNPROC=512

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

6. **Reload and Start the Service**

   Reload systemd and start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable fail2ban-api.service
   sudo systemctl start fail2ban-api.service
   ```

## Usage

Once the service is running, the API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Available Endpoints:

- **GET /status**: Get the overall Fail2Ban status.
- **GET /status/{jail_name}**: Get the status of a specific jail.
- **GET /version**: Retrieve the Fail2Ban version.

## Security Best Practices

- Run the service in a secure, isolated environment.
- Use HTTPS when deploying in production environments.
- Ensure Fail2Ban is configured properly and restrict access to the API.
